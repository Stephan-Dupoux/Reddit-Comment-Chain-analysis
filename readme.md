__Introduction to Conversational Threading Word2vec with__

Word2Vec can detect a conversation when it is on discussion

Google News Corpus tends to underestimate the similarity of text

Google Corpus fares worse with comment chains where it largely follows around jokes

Reddit Corpus CAN detect jokes

Also good with finding meaning of the text

Potentially can signal if subreddits are less strict with the moderation with comments going off topic

Noticeable clusters of Discussions and jokes comments in a chain

can see comments where Reddit hates Reddit conversation\)

Based on research on detecting Dark Triad Traits with ML models\, Main goal was to see if machines can detect conversations between different users

Word2Vec is an unsupervised learning model that takes words makes it a vector\.

Google News Model is the base model

Questions to ask

Can machines effectively detect conversations and relate similarity between each other

Can you see based on conversations if a subreddit is poorly moderated

Do different spaces affect the similarities between threads

Reddit Dataset was kind of small\. Some subreddits are very small and didnâ€™t have the required 8 comment chain

Reddit corpus is not as large as the google news corpus\, simply due to limitations of training computer and minimal RAM

Questions to ask

Gathered the top posts from six subreddits and took a comment chain of 8 from each post

I Am A

Created a word2vec model with 6 million comments from November 2019

Computed the cosine distance with the Google News Corpus and Reddit Corpus

Top comment chain\, next level chain

Detecting when comments start veering off\-topics

Seeing when jokes come from the meaning of text

Gaining meaning from the text
